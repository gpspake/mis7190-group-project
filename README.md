## Problem Statement
"Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States." [[1](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/)] As the health risks and costs associated with tobacco use have become more widely known, interest in effective cessation of tobacco use has grown. To understand the effectiveness of cessation efforts, it is important to understand trends related to tobacco use. Fortunately, there is a great deal quality data available related to tobacco use. By measuring this data, we can begin to consider the effectiveness of cessation programs and look for other factors that affect tobacco use.

## Business Questions
**First, analyze limited data and create visualizations to reveal trends...**

What does the data indicate about tobacco use:
- overall?
- by gender?
- by race?
- by other factors?

**Second, based on initial results, define evaluative questions that may be answered through more in depth analysis...**

- Does the data provide clues as to why tobacco use has become more or less prevalent over time?
- Does the data reveal meaningful information about differences in tobacco use among various demographics?
- Does analysis lead to new questions that might be answered with additional data?

## Organization and File Structure
Each data set has its own directory that includes:
- readme that includes the data source, a description of the data, and visualizations
- data set in csv format
- an example.r script that reads the data set to a variable, using a path relative to the file, to be used as a template
- any additional scripts that have been created to analyze the data
- screenshots of visualizations that correspond to scripts
