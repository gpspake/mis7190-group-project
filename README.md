## Business Questions
First, analyze limited data and create visualizations to reveal trends.

What does the data indicate about tobacco use:
- overall?
- by gender?
- by race?
- by other factors?

Second, based on initial results, define evaluative questions that may be answered through more in depth analysis

- Does the data provide clues as to why tobacco use has become more or less prevalent about time?
- Does the data reveal meaningful information about differences in tobacco use among various demographics?
- Does analysis lead to new questions that might be answered with additional data?
