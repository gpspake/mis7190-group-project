Percentage of stores that sold tobacco to minors in the California Youth Tobacco Purchase Survey each year from 1997 to 2014. This annual survey of illegal sales of tobacco products to minors is conducted to gauge the rate of illegal tobacco sales across California and to comply with the California Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement (STAKE) Act. All states and territories in the United States are required to assess their rate of illegal sales of tobacco to youth, pursuant to the Federal Synar Amendment. Caution should be used when comparing this statewide Youth Tobacco Purchase Survey rate to county or city illegal sales rates to minors; comparisons may be misleading due to differences in protocol, such as the age of the youth decoys.
